The results for each candidates were split among different columns, some of them without header i.e Candidate 1 gender | Candidate 1 surname | Candidate 1 first name | Candidate 1 number of votes | Candidate 1 % of registered voters | Candidate 1 % of valid votes and the pattern repeats for other 11 candidates. It was decided to name manually all columns headers in Excel so that, once uploaded in Python, we can merge the candidate result details in one single consolidate column"
